# my dot_files

These are my main dot_files. 
The initial dot is removed to keep them visible on my local machine.
I have also included my .vim folder for ultimate portability.
Made a symbolic link to ~/PORTABLE_ENV
/media/<myname>/3520-FD13/2programming_repository/git_github/dot_files/

This repo contains the following dot files and the .vim/ folder
The originals are saved in: 2programming_repository/git_github/dot_files/
The leading . is omitted for clarity (but retained in the folders)

README.md 
cp_to_P_E.sh

bashrc
vimrc
zshrc
dircolors
Xdefaults
Xresources
init.vim
spacemacs

and the following folders:

Missing folder:
.oh-my-zsh
$ sudo curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
but replace the .zshrc with the above one
